Welcome to my OOP Revision Code folder! This repository contains examples and revision materials which helped me understand and review key concepts in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Each example is designed to illustrate fundamental principles such as inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, encapsulation, exclusion and more.

- **Inheritance**: Examples demonstrating how classes can inherit properties and methods from parent classes to reduce code duplication and promote reusability.
- **Polymorphism**: Code showing how different classes can be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface, allowing for dynamic method binding.
- **Abstraction**: Illustrations of how to hide complex implementation details behind simple interfaces to improve code maintainability and readability.
- **Encapsulation**: Examples of how to protect the internal state of an object by restricting access to its attributes and methods.
- **Exclusion**: Basic examples showing direct attribute exposure without any OOP principles.
