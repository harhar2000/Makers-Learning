# # Python OOP Practice Questions
# Beginner Level

# 1. Create a Book class:
# - Define a Book class with attributes like title, author, and __price.
# - Implement a method to display the book details.
# - Implement getter and setter methods for the __price attribute, ensuring the price is always positive.



# 2. Implement a Rectangle class:
# - Create a Rectangle class with private attributes __length and __width.
# - Write methods to calculate the area and perimeter of the rectangle.
# - Provide getter and setter methods for the __length and __width, ensuring they are positive numbers.




# 3. Create a Student class:
# - Define a Student class with attributes name and __grade.
# - Implement a method to determine if the student has passed or failed based on the grade (pass mark is 50).
# - Provide methods to get and set the __grade, with validation that the grade must be between 0 and 100.

# 4. Design a BankAccount class:
# - Create a BankAccount class with attributes account_number, owner, and __balance.
# - Implement methods to deposit and withdraw money, with checks to prevent overdrafts.
# - Write a method to transfer money from one account to another, ensuring the transfer is valid.





# 5. Implement a Car class:
# - Define a Car class with attributes like make, model, year, and __mileage.
# - Provide methods to update the mileage and calculate the car's age.
# - Ensure the mileage can only increase and not decrease.





# 6. Create a Library class:
# - Create a Library class that manages a collection of books (hint: use the Book class from the first question).
# - Implement methods to add a book, remove a book, and search for a book by title.
# - Implement a method to list all books in the library.




# Advanced Level

# 7. Design a Temperature class:
# - Create a Temperature class with attributes for Celsius and Fahrenheit, but only store one internally (e.g., Celsius).
# - Implement methods to convert between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
# - Provide getter and setter methods that automatically convert between the two units, maintaining consistency.





# 8. Implement a University class:
# - Create a University class that manages a list of students (use the Student class from earlier).
# - Implement methods to add and remove students, calculate the average grade, and find the top-performing student.
# - Encapsulate the student list to prevent direct access from outside the class.





# 9. Create a ShoppingCart class:
# - Define a ShoppingCart class that holds a list of items, each with a name, price, and quantity.
# - Implement methods to add items, remove items, and calculate the total cost of the cart.
# - Include a method to apply a discount code that reduces the total cost by a percentage.





# 10. Build a Course class:
# - Create a Course class with attributes like course_name, instructor, and a private list of students enrolled.
# - Implement methods to enroll and drop students, check if a student is enrolled, and get the total number of students.
# - Ensure that a student cannot be enrolled more than once and cannot be dropped if they are not enrolled.




# Extra Challenges

# 11. Implement a SecureVault class:
# - Create a SecureVault class that stores sensitive information (e.g., passwords).
# - Implement methods to securely add, retrieve, and delete information.
# - Ensure that the information is encrypted before being stored and decrypted when retrieved.






# 12. Create a Company class:
