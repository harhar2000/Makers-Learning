# Module Overview

Here is the course content for my time at [Makers](https://makers.tech/). As I revisit the content, I'll update and push my code into the respective folder. I will additionally be pushing other revision-based code into this repo such as the [OOP](https://github.com/harhar2000/Makers-Learning/tree/main/OOP) folder
