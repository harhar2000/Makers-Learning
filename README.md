# Python Foundations

## Introduction

Welcome to `python-foundations`, a repository dedicated to practicing and demonstrating Python fundamentals. This repository contains a series of completed exercises covering various aspects of Python, from basic method calls to more advanced concepts like classes and error handling.

Welcome to `python-foundations`, a comprehensive repository I designed to revise, practice and master Python fundamentals. This repository is a compilation of completed exercises that span a range of topics in Python programming. It starts with the basics, such as method calls and functions with arguments and progresses through complex subjects like conditional logic, classes and error handling. This collection serves not only as a practice workbook but also as a reference guide for core Python concepts.


## Contents

The repository is structured into two main directories: `lib` and `tests`.

### lib

The `lib` directory contains several modules focusing on different Python concepts:

- **C1_1_calling_methods**: Examples of basic method calls in Python.
- **C1_2_calling_functions_w_arguments**: Functions with arguments and their usage.
- **C1_3_conditionals**: Implementation of conditional logic.
- **C1_4_defining_functions**: How to define and use functions in Python.
- **C2_1_lists_and_dictionaries**: Working with lists and dictionaries.
- **C2_2_classes**: Introduction to Python classes and object-oriented programming.
- **C3_1_lists_and_dicts**: Advanced exercises with lists and dictionaries.
- **C3_2_classes**: More complex examples of classes and OOP.
- **C4_1_testing_functions_with_equality**: Testing functions using equality assertions.
- **C4_2_testing_classes_with_equality**: Testing classes and their methods.
- **C4_3_testing_for_errors**: Techniques for testing and handling errors in Python.
- **password_manager**: A simple password manager application.
- **password_manager2**: An enhanced version of the password manager with additional features.

### tests

The `tests` directory contains unit tests for the respective modules in the `lib` directory, ensuring the functionality and reliability of the exercises.

- **test_C1_1_calling_methods**: Tests verifying basic method calls in Python.
- **test_C1_2_calling_functions_w_arguments**: Tests focusing on functions with arguments and their correct usage.
- **test_C1_3_conditionals**: Tests to ensure proper implementation of conditional logic.
- **test_C1_4_defining_functions**: Tests for validating the definition and usage of functions in Python.
- **test_C2_1_lists_and_dictionaries**: Tests for operations and functionalities involving lists and dictionaries.
- **test_C2_2_classes**: Tests assessing the basics of Python classes and object-oriented programming.
- **test_C3_1_lists_and_dicts**: Tests for more advanced exercises involving lists and dictionaries.
- **test_C3_2_classes**: Tests for verifying the functionalities of more complex classes and OOP concepts.
- **test_C4_1_testing_functions_with_equality**: Tests that use equality assertions to check the correctness of functions.
- **test_C4_2_testing_classes_with_equality**: Tests for evaluating the correct implementation of classes and their methods.
- **test_C4_3_testing_for_errors**: Tests focusing on error handling and testing techniques.
- **test_password_manager**: Unit tests for a simple password manager application.
- **test_password_manager2**: Unit tests for an enhanced version of the password manager with additional features.
