# Python Foundations

## Introduction

Welcome to `python-foundations`, a repository dedicated to practicing and demonstrating Python fundamentals. This repository contains a series of completed exercises covering various aspects of Python, from basic method calls to more advanced concepts like classes and error handling.

## Contents

The repository is structured into two main directories: `lib` and `tests`.

### lib

The `lib` directory contains several modules focusing on different Python concepts:

- **C1_1_calling_methods**: Examples of basic method calls in Python.
- **C1_2_calling_functions_w_arguments**: Functions with arguments and their usage.
- **C1_3_conditionals**: Implementation of conditional logic.
- **C1_4_defining_functions**: How to define and use functions in Python.
- **C2_1_lists_and_dictionaries**: Working with lists and dictionaries.
- **C2_2_classes**: Introduction to Python classes and object-oriented programming.
- **C3_1_lists_and_dicts**: Advanced exercises with lists and dictionaries.
- **C3_2_classes**: More complex examples of classes and OOP.
- **C4_1_testing_functions_with_equality**: Testing functions using equality assertions.
- **C4_2_testing_classes_with_equality**: Testing classes and their methods.
- **C4_3_testing_for_errors**: Techniques for testing and handling errors in Python.
- **password_manager**: A simple password manager application.
- **password_manager2**: An enhanced version of the password manager with additional features.

### tests

The `tests` directory contains unit tests for the respective modules in the `lib` directory.
